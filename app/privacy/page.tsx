        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to our File Conversion Service. We are committed to protecting
          your privacy and ensuring the security of the information you provide
          to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we
          collect, how we use that information, and the options available to you
          in relation to our use of this information.

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Given the nature of our service, users can convert files from any
          format to any other format. During this process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We do NOT require any sign-up, hence we do not collect names, email
            addresses, or any other personal identification data.
          </li>
          <li>
            We temporarily process the files you upload solely for the purpose
            of conversion. After the conversion is complete, we do not store
            your original or converted files.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may collect non-identifiable aggregate data, such as the number
            of conversions made in a day, to improve our service.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use the information you provide strictly for the service specified:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Files you upload are only processed for the conversion and are not
            used for any other purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggregated, non-identifiable data may be used to optimize and
            improve our service.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement advanced security measures to ensure that your files are
          protected during the conversion process. Once the conversion is done,
          files are immediately removed from our servers to ensure maximum data
          protection.

          We do not share, sell, or disclose your files to any third parties.
          Additionally, we do not integrate with third-party services for the
          purpose of file conversion.
