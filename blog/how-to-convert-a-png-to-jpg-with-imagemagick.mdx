Transforming PNG files to JPG can be critical in optimizing your website's performance as JPG files are typically smaller in size than PNGs. In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of converting PNG files to JPG using ImageMagick; a powerful, open-source image editing software!

## ImageMagick: What and Why

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries that allows you to read, write, and manipulate images in over 200 formats including PNG, JPEG, JPEG-2000, GIF, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG.

Given its capabilities, it serves as a potent tool for web developers, graphic artists, and photographers alike. Its flexibility in handling different image formats combined with its ability to use numerous algorithms makes it a powerhouse for image conversion and much more.

2. Navigate to the directory where your PNG image is located.
3. Run the following command:
